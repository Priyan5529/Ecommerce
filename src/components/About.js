                {/* <p>In 1913, young Chicago chemist Thomas Williams had a dilemma.
                  His older sister, Maybel, was in love with a man who was in love with someone else.
                  Maybel Williams did her best with what was availableâ€”she used petroleum jelly on her lashes
                  and brows to enhance them. Her brother decided to help her increase her allure by adding
                  carbon dust to the petroleum jelly, which darkened her lashes and brows more dramatically. The product worked.
                  In 1915, Maybel got her man and Thomas founded what would become the global industry giant, Maybelline,
                  named after the bride and her favourite beauty aid. </p>

                <p>Two years later, Williams introduced Maybelline Cake Mascara,
                  the first modern eye cosmetic made for everyday use.
                  Initially available only through mail order, it was so popular that women began to ask for it in drugstores.
                  The signature red Eyebrow Pencil followed, along with coloured eyeshadows and complementary eyeliners, leading
                  the youthful, flapper fashion trend of dramatic makeup. Maybelline became the first cosmetic company to
                  advertise on radio and sales boomed. In 1932, responding to incessant demand, Maybelline introduced a
                  special 10-cent package of Cake Mascara for retail sale. And the rest, as they say, is history!</p> */}
